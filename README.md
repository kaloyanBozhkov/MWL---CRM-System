<h1>MWL - CRM System</h1>
I had a week to work on a CRM system, this was a task done as part of the hiring process for the specific company I ended up working for. I had ot design a database structure and explain the way my system would interract with it, but ended up finishing the entire task as an entire "prototype" kind of thing, all within the same time period.

The overall idea of the project is to have a CRM system that allows to track different companies' different branches' different clients' different phone numbers and email addresses. Relly makes much more sense once it is seen in action :D
