<h1>MWL - CRM System</h1>
I had a week to work on a CRM system, this was a task done as part of the hiring process for the specific company I ended up working for. The original task revolved around designing a database structure and explaining the way a CRM system would interract with it. Instead, I over-delivered by creating an entire working "prototype" for the given concept, with back-end and front-end working as would be expected of a final product, all within the same time period.

The overall idea of the project is to have a CRM system that allows to track different companies' different branches' different clients' different phone numbers and email addresses. Relly makes much more sense once it is seen in action :D
